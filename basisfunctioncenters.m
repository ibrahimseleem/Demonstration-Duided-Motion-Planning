% Get the equidistant centers and widths of a set of basis functions
%
%
% Input:
%   n_basis_functions - number of basis functions
%   time              - length of the movement in time
%   alpha             - canonical system parameter
%                       optional: if it is passed, the basis functions are
%                       placed in phase space such that they are equidistantly
%                       placed in time space.
%
% Output:
%   centers - centers of the basis functions
%   widths  - widths of the basis functions
